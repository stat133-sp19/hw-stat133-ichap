## Workout 1

The aim of this project is to use RStudio as well as some Git Terminal codes to utilize and manipulate raw data files to create dynamic graphics that helps visualize the data. This is important because looking at raw data files in textEdit or even excel can be unattractive, as it is both tedious and hard to look at such files and make any meaningful conclusions.
